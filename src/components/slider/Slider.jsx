          <p>
            Tarot cards are an age-old method of predicting the future with the
            help of 78 cards. Each of these cards carries a special archetypal
            symbol that represents the future. A psychic or a person with
            knowledge of tarot cards can uncover the meaning of these cards. The
            present-day tarot cardsâ€™ meanings were interpreted by Etteilla and
            Marie-Anne Adelaide Lenormand.
